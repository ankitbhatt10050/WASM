to run wasm code run command "xxd -g1 sum.wasm"


to compile and build wasm automatically we are adding dependency in cargo.toml file "wasm-bindgen = "0.2.63" "

also we are installing "wasm-pack" using command "cargo install wasm-pack"
if it gets failed to install use "cargo install wasm-pack --force"

we use command "wasm-pack build --target web" to build our rust code to JS
"wasm_bindgen" in dependency helps in sharing code
